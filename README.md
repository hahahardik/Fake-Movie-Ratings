This repo contains some fun and some "serious" projects I created. Here is a brief description of the projects.

## [Fake Movie Ratings](https://github.com/hahahardik/Projects/tree/main/Fake-Movie-Ratings)

If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

In this project I have tried to perform a statistical analysis of data.The analysis is based on an article [Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/), Especially Fandangoâ€™s by [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/).

The data is taken from [FiveThirtyEight's GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). The data consits of two .csv files, one with Fandango Stars and Displayed Ratings, and the other with aggregate data for movie ratings from other sites, like [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/), [IMDB](https://www.imbd.com/), and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).
